With over two years of experience at **banking** and currently pursuing an Administration degree, I am passionate about the intersection of finance and technology.

My journey began in traditional banking roles and evolved into a technical position within a **brokerage firm**. I use **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** daily to:

* Monitor and audit financial data pipelines.
* Develop and maintain BI dashboards for decision-making.
* Manipulate and extract data to support business operations.

My goal is to continue solving complex financial problems with code.
